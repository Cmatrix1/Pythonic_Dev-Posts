In the above example, we defined a User model inheriting from BaseModel provided by Pydantic. The model has three fields: name, age, and email, each annotated with their respective types. By creating an instance of the User class with valid data, Pydantic automatically validates the input against the defined schema and assigns the values to the corresponding attributes.

The real power of Pydantic lies in its ability to handle complex validations, default values, and serialization/deserialization of data. You can define optional fields, perform complex validation logic, and even nest models within each other.

For a more comprehensive understanding of Pydantic and its advanced features, I highly recommend checking out this tutorial on YouTube: Pydantic Tutorial. and  Pydantic Documents

I will be covering numerous posts about Pydantic in the future because it is an Perfect library. Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
