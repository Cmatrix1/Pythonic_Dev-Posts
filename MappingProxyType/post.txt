MappingProxyType

üó∫Ô∏è The MappingProxyType is a built-in type in Python that provides a read-only view of a mapping object. It allows you to create a read-only version of a dictionary, which can be useful in situations where you want to prevent accidental modification of the original dictionary.

ü§î So, why would you want to use a MappingProxyType?

1Ô∏è‚É£ Security: If you have a dictionary that contains sensitive information, you may not want to allow anyone to modify it. By creating a MappingProxyType, you can ensure that the original dictionary remains unchanged.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Performance: If you have a large dictionary that you need to pass around to multiple functions, creating a MappingProxyType can be more efficient than creating a copy of the dictionary each time.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Convenience: If you have a dictionary that you want to make available to multiple functions, but you don't want any of those functions to modify the dictionary, creating a MappingProxyType can be a convenient way to achieve this.
