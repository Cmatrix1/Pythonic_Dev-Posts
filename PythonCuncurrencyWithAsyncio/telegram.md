**📘 Chapter 1: Getting to Know Asyncio**

🔄 What is `asyncio`?
`asyncio` is a Python library introduced in version 3.4 that allows you to run I/O-bound tasks concurrently. Rather than making your code wait for slow operations, `asyncio` allows multiple tasks to run "in parallel" by **pausing** tasks when they’re waiting for I/O. This allows Python to work on other tasks in the meantime.

🖥️ I/O-bound vs. CPU-bound Tasks
- **I/O-bound**: Tasks that wait for input/output, such as web requests or database queries. These tasks benefit greatly from `asyncio` as it allows them to pause and let other tasks run while waiting.
- **CPU-bound**: Tasks that use lots of computational power (like math calculations). `asyncio` isn't designed for CPU-heavy tasks.

⚙️ Concurrency, Parallelism, and Multitasking
- **Concurrency**: When multiple tasks appear to be running at the same time by taking turns. For example, while one task is waiting for a file to download, another task can start.
- **Parallelism**: When tasks are literally running at the same time on multiple CPU cores.
- **Multitasking**: Managing several tasks at once. This can be **preemptive** (the OS decides when to switch between tasks) or **cooperative** (tasks decide when to yield control). `asyncio` uses **cooperative multitasking**, meaning tasks "cooperate" by pausing when they reach I/O.

🔄 Processes vs. Threads
- **Processes**: Independent units that do not share memory. They are good for CPU-bound tasks but use more resources.
- **Threads**: Lighter-weight than processes and share memory within the same program. However, Python’s **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)** prevents threads from running Python code at the same time (no parallel execution). Still, threads are useful for I/O-bound tasks.

🔐 Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)
- **GIL** is a mechanism in Python that allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time, even on multi-core systems. 
- This makes **multithreading** less useful for CPU-bound operations but still beneficial for I/O-bound tasks because I/O releases the GIL.

⚡ Single-threaded Concurrency
`asyncio` achieves concurrency **without needing multiple threads** by using **non-blocking I/O** and an **event loop**. 

📬 What is a Socket? 
A **socket** is a low-level connection to send and receive data over a network. By default, sockets are **blocking**, meaning they make the program wait while they communicate. **Non-blocking** sockets allow the program to continue executing other tasks while waiting for a response. This is key to how `asyncio` achieves concurrency with just one thread.

🔄 Event Loop
- An **event loop** is a core part of how `asyncio` works. It’s a loop that runs tasks, pausing and resuming them as necessary. The event loop checks if tasks are waiting on I/O and either runs them or pauses them until they’re ready.
- Tasks that involve I/O can pause and free up the loop to run other tasks, making programs more efficient.

🕹️ How It Works:
1. Tasks are submitted to the **event loop**.
2. The loop starts running tasks. If a task hits an I/O operation (like a web request), the task **pauses**.
3. The **operating system** watches the socket and informs the event loop when the I/O is complete.
4. The event loop resumes the paused task and continues processing.

🤔 Why Use `asyncio`?
- **Improves performance** for programs that do a lot of waiting (web servers, file reading).
- **Lightweight** and doesn’t need multiple threads or processes to handle concurrency.
- **Efficient resource utilization**: While waiting for slow I/O operations, the CPU can continue working on other tasks, leading to faster overall execution.

🚀 Key Takeaways:
- `asyncio` is ideal for **I/O-bound tasks** and allows you to write concurrent programs using a single thread.
- It **does not** remove Python's GIL but makes it less of an issue by focusing on I/O tasks.
- **Non-blocking I/O** and the **event loop** allow tasks to pause and resume, making concurrency efficient even with just one thread.
